# The Banana Translator
Are you a fan of minions? Did you know that the gibberish they say is an actual language. Use this translator to convert your text from English to Minion speak or Banana language. Share it with your friends as well!

### How does the App work?
This Vanilla JS app first takes input from the user in English and as soon as the user clicks on the Translate button, it shows the translated text in the output field. The App translates English text into Minion language by using [this API](https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/minion.json). To learn more, check out the App above!
